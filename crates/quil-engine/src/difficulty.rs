//! Rust port of

//!
//! Implements the ASERTi3-2d integer-arithmetic difficulty adjustment
//! algorithm, adapted for Quilibrium's VDF-based proof of time. Go's
//! implementation deliberately uses integer Q16 fixed-point math to
//! avoid floating-point non-determinism across architectures — we
//! mirror the same integer pipeline bit-for-bit so both
//! implementations produce identical outputs for the same
//! `(anchor_frame, anchor_time, anchor_difficulty, current_frame,
